## Current Focus

### Authentication System Status
Current State:
- Using default user (id: 1) for all operations
- Removed bcrypt and JWT dependencies for cross-platform compatibility
- Implemented simplified development mode authentication
- All authentication endpoints return default user data
- API structure preserved for future implementation

Development Mode Components:
- User table schema maintained but not actively used
- Simplified authentication middleware (auth.ts)
- Development token handling
- Modified user routes and services
- Clear documentation of development mode behavior

Future Implementation Plan:
1. Research alternative cross-platform authentication solutions
2. Design platform-independent authentication system
3. Implement proper user registration and login
4. Enable authentication middleware on protected routes
5. Add user management features
6. Update frontend for authentication flow

- [ ] Implement memoization where beneficial
- [ ] Optimize grid updates
- [ ] Improve rendering efficiency

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for parameter management
- [ ] Integration tests for state handling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] User interaction testing

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Enhanced UserGuide.md
- ✅ Updated Sprint2 documentation
- ✅ Improved README.md

### Known Issues

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Authentication system simplified for development:
  - Using default user (id: 1) for all operations
  - No password hashing or token verification
  - API structure maintained for future implementation
- Future considerations:
  - Research platform-independent authentication solutions
  - Design authentication system that works across architectures

[Rest of Known Issues section remains unchanged]

#### Core Functionality
- Simulation loading functionality is not operational
- Parameter changes after simulation start have issues:
  - Changes don't properly affect simulation behavior
  - Exported data doesn't accurately reflect modifications
  - Users must set all parameters before starting simulation

#### Performance and Testing
- Performance monitoring needed for large grids
- Comprehensive testing suite required
- User interaction testing pending

#### User Interface
- Ongoing parameter UI feedback collection
- Need improved error handling for parameter changes
- Better user feedback needed for simulation state changes

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Complete performance optimization tasks
2. Implement comprehensive testing suite
3. Gather user feedback on new features
4. Address critical functionality issues:
   - Fix simulation loading functionality
   - Implement proper parameter change handling during simulation
   - Ensure exported data reflects all parameter changes
5. Address any other reported issues

### Medium Term
1. Consider implementing:
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Simulation playback controls
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Advanced export options
2. Begin planning cross-platform authentication:
   - Research platform-independent authentication solutions
   - Design authentication system that works across architectures
   - Plan gradual transition from development mode

[Rest of Medium Term section remains unchanged]

### Long Term
1. Explore possibilities for:
   - 3D visualization
   - Multiple simulation comparison
   - Advanced analytics features
   - Mobile optimization
2. Implement full authentication system:
   - User registration and login
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure password management
   - Session handling
