## Current Focus

### Authentication System Status
Current State:
- Using default user (id: 1) for all operations to simplify testing
- Temporarily removed bcrypt due to ARM/x86 compatibility issues
- Preserved authentication infrastructure for future implementation

Existing Components:
- User table schema with authentication fields
- Authentication middleware (auth.ts)
- JWT-based token verification
- Protected routes in server.ts
- User routes and services

Future Implementation Plan:
1. Re-enable bcrypt with cross-platform build configuration
2. Implement proper user registration and login
3. Enable authentication middleware on protected routes
4. Add user management features
5. Update frontend for authentication flow

Known Issues:
- bcrypt compatibility between ARM and x86 architectures
- Solution: Temporary removal for development, plan proper cross-platform setup
