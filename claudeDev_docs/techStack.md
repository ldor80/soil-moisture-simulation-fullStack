# Technology Stack

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Next.js
  - Rationale: Leverages existing codebase, provides excellent performance and SEO capabilities.
- **State Management**: Redux
  - Rationale: Robust solution for managing complex application state, especially useful for simulations.
- **API Communication**: Axios
  - Rationale: Promise-based HTTP client that simplifies API requests and error handling.

## Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
  - Rationale: JavaScript runtime that allows for code sharing between frontend and backend.
- **Framework**: Express.js
  - Rationale: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, ideal for building robust APIs.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - Rationale: Stateless authentication mechanism, suitable for scalable applications.

## Databases
- **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Rationale: Robust, open-source relational database for storing structured data (users, simulation metadata).
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB
  - Rationale: Flexible schema design, ideal for storing varied simulation data.

## Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Library**: Socket.io
  - Rationale: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

## Testing
- **Unit and Integration Testing**: Jest
  - Rationale: Zero-config testing platform, works well with React and Node.js.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Cypress
  - Rationale: Fast, easy, and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.

## Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
  - Rationale: Simplifies API development and documentation process.

## Containerization
- **Container Platform**: Docker
  - Rationale: Ensures consistency across different development and deployment environments.

## CI/CD
- **Pipeline**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
  - Rationale: Automates testing and deployment processes, integrates well with version control.

## Data Export
- **Formats**: JSON, CSV
  - Rationale: Widely supported formats for data interchange and analysis.

This tech stack provides a robust foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich simulation application. It allows for efficient development, easy deployment, and the flexibility to handle future growth and feature additions.
