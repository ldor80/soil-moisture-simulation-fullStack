5. Create basic user profile management ✅
6. Containerize the application using Docker ✅
7. Set up testing environment ✅
8. Implement tests for user authentication ✅
9. Implement input validation and error handling ✅

15. Implement load simulation functionality ✅

## Completed Tasks

### 1-14. [Previous tasks remain unchanged]

### 15. Implement Load Simulation Functionality
- [x] Create a new page for loading simulations (app/load-simulation/page.tsx)
- [x] Implement API endpoint for retrieving a specific simulation (GET /api/simulations/{id})
- [x] Update the Simulation page to handle loading saved simulation data
- [x] Modify the initializeGrid function to work with both new and saved simulations
- [x] Update Swagger documentation for the new endpoint

## Sprint Outcome
All planned tasks for Sprint 1 have been successfully completed, including the additional task of implementing the load simulation functionality. We have set up a solid foundation for our Soil Irrigation Simulator backend, including user authentication, database integration, testing, API documentation, containerization, simulation data management, data export functionality, and the ability to load saved simulations. The backend now fully supports the data structure required by the frontend application and allows users to save, export, and load simulations.

## Next Steps
1. Implement frontend integration with the updated backend API
2. Enhance error handling and input validation for the simulation endpoints
3. Implement real-time updates for ongoing simulations
4. Conduct thorough testing of the integrated system, including the new load simulation functionality
5. Optimize performance for loading and displaying large simulations
6. Update user documentation to reflect the new features and data structure

## Lessons Learned
[Previous lessons learned remain unchanged]
- Implementing a flexible data structure that can handle both new and saved simulations requires careful planning and consideration of all possible use cases.
- Proper separation of concerns between data fetching, state management, and UI rendering leads to more maintainable and scalable code.

## Challenges Faced
[Previous challenges faced remain unchanged]
- Ensuring that the loaded simulation data is correctly applied to all aspects of the simulation, including grid state, parameters, and visualization components.
- Maintaining consistency between the data structure used for saving simulations and the one used for running simulations in real-time.

## For Future Consideration
[Previous considerations remain unchanged]
- Implement a more robust error handling system for loading simulations, including the ability to recover from partially corrupted or incompatible saved data.
- Consider implementing a diff-based approach for saving simulations to reduce data storage requirements for long-running simulations with minimal changes.
- Explore the possibility of implementing a "simulation playback" feature that allows users to step through the history of a saved simulation.
