# Adaptive Instructions

This document logs project-specific insights and user preferences to guide our development process.

## User Preferences
- Flexibility in deployment options (local, cloud, Docker)
- Emphasis on maintaining existing functionality while adding new features

## Project Insights
- The existing codebase is a React/Next.js application
- The simulation is grid-based and focuses on soil moisture dynamics
- Real-time updates and data persistence are key new features to implement

## Development Approach
- Prioritize modular development to easily integrate new features with existing code
- Implement comprehensive testing to ensure new features don't break existing functionality
- Focus on scalability and performance, especially for larger simulations

## Communication Style
- Provide clear, technical explanations for implementation decisions
- Regularly update on progress and seek feedback on implemented features

This document will be updated throughout the development process as we gain more insights and learn about user preferences.
